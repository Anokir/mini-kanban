# Mini-Kanban
This Kanban demo application serves as a visual project management tool designed to help users organize tasks and enhance productivity. While it showcases the essential features of a traditional Kanban board, such as task creation, status updates, and user assignments, it does not include all functionalities found in a full-fledged Kanban application. This demo provides a simplified interface for users to experience the Kanban methodology, allowing them to visualize and manage their workflow effectively.
